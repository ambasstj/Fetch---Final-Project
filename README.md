Recipes - Powered by Fetch

Project Overview

**Recipes - Powered by Fetch** is an iOS app that leverages two MealDB APIs to offer users a rich culinary experience. It provides a user-friendly interface with a variety of features, including a table view displaying dessert items with names and images. When a user selects an item, they are directed to a recipe card, which showcases the dish's name, a larger image, an embedded YouTube video guide on how to prepare the dish, and scrollable sections listing written instructions and ingredients. All this valuable information is sourced directly from the MealDB API.

Features

- Browse a selection of dessert items with names and images.
- Explore individual recipe cards with detailed dish information.
- Watch embedded YouTube videos for step-by-step cooking instructions.
- View ingredient lists and written cooking instructions.
- Create user accounts with Firebase Auth SDK for a personalized experience.

Challenges Faced

The most significant challenge encountered during the development of this project was the loss of commit history in Git due to corrupted commits. This issue arose, likely because of limited system resources, causing my machine to operate slowly during tasks such as making commits, running the simulator, and performing tests.

Despite this challenge, the project was both rewarding and enjoyable, as it provided an opportunity to explore various features and integrations, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
